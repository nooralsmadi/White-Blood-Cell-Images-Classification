# White-Blood-Cell-Images-Classification
This repository contains the work for an advanced machine learning project aimed at classifying white blood cells into various categories such as neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. The project leverages image processing and computer vision techniques to facilitate accurate medical diagnosis and support research efforts.

# Problem and Methodology

This Project covers :
-  Imbalanced data
-  Image augmentation
-  Feature extraction using Gabor filter
-  XGBoost

# Description
There are four different types of white blood cells. Although they appear similar, they each have distinct functions.The task here is to classify them using Machine Learning!
